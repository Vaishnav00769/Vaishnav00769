## About Me

I'm a Computer Science undergraduate passionate about solving problems with machine learning and automation.  
I specialize in building fast, lightweight, and purposeful AI tools that people can actually use. Whether it’s sending personalized emails, predicting fraud, or planning trips — I design and deploy solutions end-to-end.

Currently exploring:
- LLM prompt optimization
- Streamlit & backend automation
- n8n workflows
- Real-world ML applications in finance and travel
