## About Me

I'm Vaishnav Agarwal, a Computer Science undergraduate on a focused journey to become a professional AI/ML Engineer.  
Every project I build is an opportunity to learn — from data preprocessing and modeling to deployment and UI design.

My long-term goal is to work at the forefront of AI innovation in organizations like **OpenAI**, **Google DeepMind**, or similar.  
I'm currently gaining experience by designing and building end-to-end applications in Python with an emphasis on machine learning and LLMs.
