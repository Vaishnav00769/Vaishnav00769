<summary><b>About Me</b></summary>

I am a Computer Science student at CMR Technical Campus (2023–2027) with a strong foundation in mathematics and physics.  
My work focuses on developing machine learning systems, LLM-integrated tools, and real-world AI applications using Python and open-source frameworks.  
I have implemented fraud detection systems, AI travel planners, and outreach automation tools using APIs, prompt chaining, and automation platforms like n8n.
